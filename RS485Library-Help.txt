Notes:

This fle is to help you use the RS485 library.
    Using main.py you can:
        -add multiple slave Arduino boards
        -call from a wide range of pre written callables
        -run different methods that call from the callable list to unlock complete hardware control


As of right now the working callables include:
    moveStepper
    blinkLED
    toggleLED
    disable

At the top of the main.py file, do a few things

Do the following import lines:

from pidev.SlaveMaster import SerialMaster, Arduino
from pidev import RPiMIB
import time

And open the path:

RPiMIB.openSPI()

Create an Arduino Object:

a = Arduino(SerialMaster(baud=115200), 17)

The line above declares 'a' as an Arduino Object, at port 17.
Each Arduino will have its own name (in this case, 'a'), and its own port, in this case '17'
The port is declared at the top of the Arduino file, with '#define ADDRESS 17'
(The port is arbitrary)


void moveStepper(byte dataLength, byte *dataArray) {

    An example of how to call the function in the py file would be:

    print(a.moveStepper([1, 1] + list((200).to_bytes(2, "little")), format_out=FORMAT_STRING))

    The first parameter determines the port of the motor (i.e. 1, 2...)

    The second parameter determines the direction of the stepper.
        '0' is ClockWise and '1' is CounterClockWise

    The '200' in the list to bytes section of the code is the steps.
    The stepper needs 800 steps in order to make a full revolution, when it is  in the quarter step setting.
    The step setting can be changed on the Arduino Board, and should be updated in the code.
    For example, in the full step mode, 200 steps will result in a revolution.

    The 'a' at the beginning of the call is the Arduino Object.
